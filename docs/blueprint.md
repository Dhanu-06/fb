- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke trust and transparency.

- Accent color: Soft green (#90EE90) for approvals and positive indicators, providing a subtle contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, for a blend of modernity and readability
- Use simple, consistent icons from a set like Font Awesome or Material Icons to represent categories, actions, and status indicators.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout with ample whitespace to improve readability and focus on key information. Prioritize responsive design for mobile-friendliness.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and feedback, such as loading spinners or approval confirmations. Avoid distracting or unnecessary animations.
